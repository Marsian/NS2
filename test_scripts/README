This test script simulates satellite connection handover with MPTCP in iridium satellite system.

1. To run this simulation:

$ ns sat-iridium-mptcp-random.tcl [name] [duration] [node1-latitude] [node1-longitude] [node2-latitude] [node2-longitude] [random-seed]

e.g. $ ns sat-iridium-mptcp-random.tcl mptcp 150 17.4 127.55 15.51 -1 1


After you run this script, it will take some time and generate a trace file in current directory named [name].tr (e.g. mptcp.tr)


2. throughput-script is used for collecting the data in trace file and generate a total throughput of two TCP sub-flows.
To run this script:
$./throughput-script

Note that to run this script, you need three extra scripts: mptcpsum.pl, throughput.pl and throughput-plot-multiNode.

After you run this script, it will generate two separate TCP sub-flows’ throughput, total throughput, and figures for each throughput file.

3. delayr-script is used for calculating the latency of transmission before/during/after handover.
To run this script:
$ sh delayr-script [filename] [range] [src1] [dst1] [src2] [dst2] [before-handover-time] [after-handover-time]

e.g. sh delayr-script mptcp 10 68 70 69 71 30 96

Note that to run this script, you need two extra scripts: avg, delay.

After you run this script, it will write the average latency to the file avg-delay. Remember to remove “random” (a tmp file generated by the scripts) before re-run the script.
